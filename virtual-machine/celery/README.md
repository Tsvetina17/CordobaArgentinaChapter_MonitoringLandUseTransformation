# Celery Instance

## Requirements

Celery library has a Redis flavor that can be installed locally:

```bash
pip install celery[redis]
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This installs Celery plus the needed dependencies, and `pip freeze` prepares the file for the Dockerfile to use.

## Application

The application has 2 modules:

- celery_app.py: Connection to the REDIS instance for broker database and results database. General Celery application config + logging config.
- tasks.py: All the application registered tasks.

## Dockerfile

The Celery instance requires connection to the Redis instance, which acts as broker; so in this case, we need a custom Dockerfile to instruct Docker on how to build the application. The setup is very simple, includes files transfer into the container, installing the requirements from the requirements file and the command to launch the Celery worker(s). 

There's an alternative Dockerfile, saved with extension .txt, and an entrypoint script file, which implements priorities and deploys 2 workers to handle those. This feature is experimental and not implemented in the current code.

## Deployment using Docker Compose

Deployed with the main [Docker Compose](virtual-machine\docker-compose.yaml) file.
